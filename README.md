Learning Portfolio
Introduction
Welcome to my learning portfolio! This document serves as a README to provide insight into the purpose and contents of this portfolio.
Purpose
This portfolio is a showcase of my learning journey and the breadth of my knowledge in basic programming concepts. It includes practice exercises, mini-projects, and explorations into fundamental programming constructs. Whether it's experimenting with basic functions, delving into core programming paradigms like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), exploring introductory topics in computer science, or understanding blockchain technology, each entry in this portfolio represents a foundational step forward in my understanding and proficiency.

Contents
1. Basic Programming Functions
Practice exercises demonstrating fundamental programming functions such as input/output, arithmetic operations, conditionals, loops, and basic data manipulation.
2. Introduction to Control Flow
Explorations into basic control flow constructs including if statements, for loops, while loops, and switch statements.
3. Data Types and Variables
Exercises focusing on different data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings) and variable declarations in various programming languages.
4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Understanding and implementation of OOP concepts including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
5. Blockchain
Basic understanding of blockchain technology, including creating simple blockchain implementations, understanding consensus mechanisms, and experimenting with smart contracts.
6. Mini-Projects
Small-scale projects focusing on applying basic programming concepts to solve simple problems or implement elementary applications.
Conclusion
This portfolio serves as evidence of my commitment to mastering basic programming principles and laying a solid foundation for further learning and growth in the field of computer science. Each entry reflects my dedication to understanding fundamental concepts and building proficiency in practical coding skills.
